        <h2>Privacy Statement</h2>

        <h3>SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
        <p>
          When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and
          selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such
          as your name, address, and email address.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your
          computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with
          information that helps us learn about your browser and operating
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you
          emails about our store, new products, and other updates.
        </p>

        <h3>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h3>
        <h4>How do you get my consent?</h4>
        <p>
          When you provide us with personal information to complete a
          transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a
          delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our
          collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like
          marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent
          or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
        </p>

        <h4>How do I withdraw my consent?</h4>
        <p>
          If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your
          consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use, or
          disclosure of your information at any time, by contacting us at
          <a>mavinash422@gmail.com</a> or mailing us at: D33, 1/2 IT Colony, CBD
          Belapur, Navi Mumbai 400614.
        </p>

        <h3>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to
          do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <h3>SECTION 4 - PAYMENT</h3>
        <p>
          We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your
          card data on their servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment
          Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing
          payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is
          necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is
          complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed
          by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of
          brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.
        </p>
        <p>
          PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
          information by our store and its service providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more insight, you may also want to read the terms and conditions
          of Razorpay at <a href="https://razorpay.com">razorpay.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h3>
        <p>
          In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect,
          use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow
          them to perform the services they provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment
          gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own
          privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to
          provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies
          so you can understand the manner in which your personal information
          will be handled by these providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or
          have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than
          either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that
          involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your
          information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in
          which that service provider or its facilities are located.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party
          website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy
          Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <h4>Links</h4>
        <p>
          When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from
          our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other
          sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.
        </p>

        <h3>SECTION 6 - SECURITY</h3>
        <p>
          To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions
          and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not
          inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered, or
          destroyed.
        </p>

        <h3>SECTION 8 - AGE OF CONSENT</h3>
        <p>
          By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of
          majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the
          age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have
          given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use
          this site.
        </p>

        <p>
          If our store is acquired or merged with another company, your
          information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may
          continue to sell products to you.
        </p>
