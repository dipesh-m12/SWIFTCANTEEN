      <h2>Privacy Statement</h2>

      <h3>SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
      <p>
        When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and
        selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such
        as your name, address, and email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your
        computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with
        information that helps us learn about your browser and operating
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you
        emails about our store, new products, and other updates.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h3>
      <h4>How do you get my consent?</h4>
      <p>
        When you provide us with personal information to complete a
        transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a
        delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our
        collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like
        marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent
        or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
      </p>

      <h4>How do I withdraw my consent?</h4>
      <p>
        If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your
        consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use, or
        disclosure of your information at any time, by contacting us at
        <a>krishna@mes.ac.in</a> or mailing us at: D33, 1/2 IT Colony, CBD
        Belapur, Navi Mumbai 400614.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to
        do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 4 - PAYMENT</h3>
      <p>
        We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your
        card data on their servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment
        Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing
        payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is
        necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is
        complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed
        by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of
        brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.
      </p>
      <p>
        PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
        information by our store and its service providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more insight, you may also want to read the terms and conditions
        of Razorpay at <a href="https://razorpay.com">razorpay.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h3>
      <p>
        In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect,
        use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow
        them to perform the services they provide to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment
        gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own
        privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to
        provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies
        so you can understand the manner in which your personal information
        will be handled by these providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or
        have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than
        either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that
        involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your
        information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in
        which that service provider or its facilities are located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party
        website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy
        Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <h4>Links</h4>
      <p>
        When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from
        our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other
        sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 6 - SECURITY</h3>
      <p>
        To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions
        and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not
        inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered, or
        destroyed.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 8 - AGE OF CONSENT</h3>
      <p>
        By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of
        majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the
        age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have
        given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use
        this site.
      </p>

      <p>
        If our store is acquired or merged with another company, your
        information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may
        continue to sell products to you.
      </p>

      <h3>QUESTIONS AND CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>

      <h2>Pricing</h2>
      <p>
        For canteens looking to enhance their operations with our app, we offer a
        simple and transparent pricing model:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>One-Time Payment:</strong> ₹60,000 - This includes the
          development cost and operational charges necessary to set up the app for
          your canteen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Yearly Maintenance:</strong> ₹12,000 - An annual maintenance fee
          that covers continued support, updates, and smooth functioning of the app
          after the first year.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once implemented, you can set and manage your own food prices directly
        through the app!
